# Game Instructions

The game **Labyrinth** is as follows:

## Basics, Objectives, and Monsters
The **player** is placed into a location in a **maze** of unknown size and shape.  
The maze is organized by a Cartesian system (i.e. a 2-dimensional grid).

Located somewhere in the maze is a **treasure** and an **exit**. The *goal* of the game is to collect the treasure and escape the labyrinth through the exit.

Also located in the maze are **mirrors** and **minotaurs**, both of which will appear as eyes in the darkness. The mirror will not harm the player, but the minotaur will kill the player if it is not shot and killed.

## Combat

The player begins with a revolver, **bullet(s)** (often 1 or 2), and one **extra life**. Additional bullets can be found in the maze.  
Upon entering a room and noticing eyes in the darkness, a player can choose to *shoot a bullet* or *hold their fire*.

* If the player shoots a mirror, the mirror will crack and the bullet will be wasted.
* If the player shoots a minotaur, the minotaur will be killed and the player will be saved.
* If the player does not shoot a mirror, nothing happens.
* If the player does not shoot a minotaur, the minotaur will kill the player.

## Lives
The player's extra life will allow the player to respawn once in another sector of the maze, with their revolver and bullets.

If both lives are lost, then the player loses.  
If the player reaches the exit with the treasure, then the player wins.
