#Instructions

The game Labyrinth is as follows:

The player is placed into a location in a maze of unknown size and shape. The maze is organized by a Cartesian system (i.e. a 2-dimensional grid).

Located somewhere in the maze is a treasure chest and an exit. The goal of the game is to collect the treasure and escape the labyrinth.
Also located in the maze are mirrors and minotaurs, both of which will appear as eyes in the darkness. The mirror will not harm the player, but the minotaur will kill the player as soon as it can.

The player begins with a revolver, X bullets (often 1 or 2), and a single extra life. Additional bullets can be found in the maze.
Upon entering a room and noticing eyes in the darkness, a player can choose to shoot a bullet or hold their fire.
	If the player shoots a mirror, the mirror will crack and the bullet will be wasted.
	If the player shoots a minotaur, the minotaur will be killed and the player will be saved.
	If the player does not shoot a mirror, nothing happens.
	If the player does not shoot a minotaur, the minotaur will kill the player.

The player has an extra life which will allow the player to respawn once in another sector of the maze, with their revolver, bullets, and treasure (if found). If both lives are lost, then the player loses.
If the player reaches the exit with the treasure, then the player wins.
